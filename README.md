## Overview
CalPal is a very versatile calendar/scheduling web application. We as developers understand that it's nearly impossible to build an app that will satisfy everybody - so we did our best to make sure that the user is able to shape the application to suit their needs, and nothing more!<br><br>

With standard calendar apps, you are forced to use a single format for all of your events. When creating events, there are many unnecessary fields, and no ability to create special fields. With CalPal, you create Calendars of event types that YOU decide! You can get the specificity of many of the more niche applications, while getting a range of utility far greater than that of any standard planning application.<br><br>

Not enough to convince you? Using CalPal, you can share events, or even whole calendars with other users! You can even give them permission to add events themselves to your calendar. You can also send and receive invitations to events.<br><br>

Get more power out of your planner, for FREE, with CalPal!
